# Abstract

Quobject's goal is to become the worlds number one educational app with a large amount of high-quality educational questions readily available for all. Quobject Designer and Quobject Explorer for Windows and macOS has been around for a couple of years now, and soon the Quobject mobile app will be available for iOS and Android. Quobject first learning path was released this year. This learning path is a collection of high-quality, high school science quizzes, all grouped into relevant topics. The next step is to grow the number and quality of the questions in this learning path. The goal finally is to cover every subject taught in high school by having a learning path for it. Creating a token issued to individuals who are working to help achieve these goals is expected to boost the spread of usage of Quobject around the world.
